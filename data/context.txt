- In 2022, the USA Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling that overturned 50 years of jurisprudence recognizing a constitutional right to abortion.
- This decision has had a massive impact: one in three women and girls of reproductive age now live in states where abortion access is either totally or near-totally inaccessible.
- The states with the most restrictive abortion laws have the weakest maternal health support, higher maternal death rates, and higher child poverty rates.
- The USA Supreme Court ruling has also had impacts beyond national borders due to the geopolitical and cultural influence wielded by the USA globally and the aid it funds.
- SRR organizations and activists across the world have expressed fear about the ruling laying the groundwork for anti-abortion legislative and policy attacks in other countries.
- Advocates have also observed the ruling's impact on progressive law reform and the stalling of the adoption and enforcement of abortion guidelines in certain African countries.
- The ruling has created a chilling effect in international policy spaces, emboldening anti-abortion state and non-state actors to undermine human rights protections.
- Fossil fuel companies, whether state or private, play a key role in the emissions that drive global warming.
- According to the Carbon Majors database, 100 existing fossil fuel companies (and eight that no longer exist) have produced almost a trillion tons of GHG emissions in 150 years.
- These 100 companies are responsible for 71% of all GHG emissions since 1988.
- In the Americas, the private companies responsible for the most emissions during this period, according to the database, are from the United States: ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Peabody.
- The largest emitter amongst state-owned companies in the Americas is Mexican company Pemex, followed by Venezuelan company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A.
- Despite the fact that people with fewer resources, in particular from countries in the global South, do not make significant contributions to climate change, it is these people who are most affected by it.
- Approximately half of the global population lives in areas that are "very vulnerable" to climate change, and it is people with considerable development constraints who are most exposed.
- This disproportionately affects the human rights of people with fewer resources and greater risk in the context of climate change in the global South.
- Between 2010 and 2020, human mortality due to climate disasters was 15 times higher in vulnerable regions and populations.

Amnesty International called on its vast network of supporters to deluge Nigerian authorities first with appeals for the defenders’ freedom, and later with letters of outrage.
Amnesty International recommends that the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders embeds a focus on child and young HRDs in the future work of the mandate. 
Amnesty International recommends raising awareness about the differences between "child" and "youth" HRDs and the different context, needs, barriers, and challenges they face as defenders. 
Amnesty International recommends incorporating age disaggregated data on the lived experiences of child and young HRDs in all future reports or interventions by the Special Rapporteur. 
Amnesty International recommends creating online and face-to-face safe spaces for child and young HRDs and their child and youth-led organizations to actively engage with the Special and other human rights mechanisms.
