"The global implications of the USA Supreme Court ruling on abortion are significant. The ruling has led to limited or no access to abortion for one in three women and girls of reproductive age in states where abortion access is restricted. These states also have weaker maternal health support, higher maternal death rates, and higher child poverty rates. Additionally, the ruling has had an impact beyond national borders due to the USA's geopolitical and cultural influence globally. Organizations and activists worldwide are concerned that the ruling may inspire anti-abortion legislative and policy attacks in other countries. The ruling has also hindered progressive law reform and the implementation of abortion guidelines in certain African countries. Furthermore, the ruling has created a chilling effect in international policy spaces, empowering anti-abortion actors to undermine human rights protections."
"According to the Carbon Majors database, the main contributors to GHG emissions and their role in global warming are fossil fuel companies. These companies, both state-owned and private, have produced almost a trillion tons of GHG emissions in 150 years. The database shows that 100 existing fossil fuel companies, along with eight that no longer exist, are responsible for 71% of all GHG emissions since 1988. In the Americas, the private companies that have contributed the most emissions are ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Peabody, all from the United States. Among state-owned companies in the Americas, the largest emitter is Mexican company Pemex, followed by Venezuelan company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. It is important to note that while people with fewer resources, particularly from countries in the global South, do not significantly contribute to climate change, they are the ones most affected by its impacts. Approximately half of the global population lives in areas that are \"very vulnerable\" to climate change, and it is people with limited development opportunities who face the greatest risks. This unequal impact disproportionately affects the human rights of those with fewer resources and greater vulnerability in the context of climate change in the global South. Additionally, between 2010 and 2020, human mortality due to climate disasters was 15 times higher in vulnerable regions and populations."

"The consequences of criminalizing abortion for marginalized individuals include increased stigma, lack of information, and disinformation. This can have severe and irreversible effects on these individuals. Girls and young women may be forced to carry pregnancies resulting from sexual violence due to a lack of knowledge about their rights. Marginalized individuals, such as those living in poverty, historically discriminated against, Indigenous and Afro-descendent women, migrants, and refugees, are disproportionately affected by abortion criminalization. The criminalization of abortion is a major factor contributing to the high number of unsafe abortions, which leads to increased maternal mortality and morbidity. Access to health services is undermined, resulting in preventable maternal deaths and complications. Marginalized individuals are forced to resort to unsafe clandestine abortion methods, putting their lives and health at risk. In Nigeria, restrictive abortion laws make it difficult to access safe abortion care."

"Amnesty International documented labor abuses in Qatar, including workers being permitted only one day off each month, threats of salary cuts for taking more rest time, failure to provide pay slips, and overcrowded and dirty living conditions. These labor abuses relate to the kafala system because the kafala system imposes tight restrictions on migrant workers' freedom of movement and ability to change jobs without their employer's permission. This system allows abusive employers to control their workforce by canceling residence permits, falsely reporting employees as absconding, and using non-compete clauses to prevent workers from changing jobs."
"The government of Qatar started repealing restrictions on migrant workers between 2018 and 2020."
